# Project Cars 2 python wrapper
A simple C++ class handling the memory mapping (please note that this, as a consequence of pcars2's design, only works on windows) is later wrapped by a simple python script. 

### Build
A boost wrapper is autogenerated upon building using cmake. The private library for the actual c++ is then build and later linked to the library build from the autogenerated boost wrapper. 

### Use
This wrapper is just for getting the data to python, it provides little more than an interface.
